24 April 2017

Run:
  - Open the executable JAR titled "GettingHelp_Carlos Barcelos"
  - Make sure that the XML file is in the same level directory as the executible JAR and be titled "manpages.xml"

Operation:
  - Type the command name into the search bar and press "Search" or press the "Enter" key in order to retrieve the man page for that command
    -- Available commands: "ls", "cs", "mkdir", "rmdir", "alias", "ar", "basename", "batch"
  - Searching for an invalid command will result in a "404" command not found result
  - In order to get help information search for "HELP" or click the "Help" button at the bottom left of the window

Notes:
  - The program reads the XML file at the start of execution, changing the contents of the file while the application
 is open will not dynamically change the contents
